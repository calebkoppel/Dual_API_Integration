# Dual_API_Integration
This project integrates two API's, one with public access, and one requiring an API key to access. Using HTML, the user starts at the root page I established in the local host using port 3000. The user is given a form that will ask for a city, state, and a movie title. I used the New York Times Movie Review API and the OpenBreweryDB API to fetch breweries in the given city, and provide a short summary of the given movie. I structured the program to run synchronously, so the movie request is always triggered before the brewery request. Additionally, I set up a local cache so if a user asks for a movie or brewery more than once, access to the API is not necessary, saving time and cost of accesssing either API.
